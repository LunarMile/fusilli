> This visualizer has two Python programs

1. main :: this reads the CSVs and generates the visualization frames.
2. renamer :: this renames each frame from their original to a simple number (Did this because I needed them as numbers to render them with FFMPEG, they were originally in a datetime format 'XX-XX-XXXX') (Now you might ask "Why didn't you just name the files numerically???", and that would be because I forgot to lol. I did not want to render each frame again as it took quite a long time, creating the supplementary program saved me quite a bit of time.)
